# [Summer Hackies Awards Ceremony](https://hackies.netlify.app/)

**Celebrate everything the community has made**: Over the past year, [Hack Clubbers](https://hackclub.com/) have been learning & building amazing projects. They've participated in 100s of [hackathons](https://hackathons.hackclub.com), shared what they've built in the Slack's [#ship](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/C0M8PUPU6/) channel and [sharing short video & photo updates](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com) every day of the summer.

As a team, we wanted to end the summer with a celebration of all the spectacular things the community has made. On TBC we will be gathering to look back as a community and acknowledging some stand out projects. Community members who are interested in being considered for an award can submit their projects.

This repo is the website for [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/)â€™s [Hackies Award Show](https://hackies.netlify.app/), which is part of the [2020 Summer of Making](https://summer.hackclub.com/).

## How do I join?

You can submit your project in two ways. 

1. Visit the [website](https://hackies.netlify.app/), choose the category you'd like to enter, click `Enter`, fill in your project details and click Submit!
2. Use Lisa, our friendly bot. Message `@lisa list` in Slack, Lisa will respond with a list of available challenges. Find the code that corresponds to the category you'd like to enter. Then message `@lisa submit [category-code] [link-to-project]`. For example use, `@lisa submit personal-website https://sampoder.com`. 

## How does it work?

The site is made with HTML, CSS & JS. It uses a modified verson of [simplegrid](https://simplegrid.io). To access Airtable it uses a simple Express based API hosted on repl.it.
